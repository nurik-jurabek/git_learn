git restore — modifies WORKING DIRECTORY or STAGING AREA

(does NOT change commit history)

Use cases:

Undo changes in a file (before staging)

Unstage a file (remove from staging but keep real file)

 git reset — modifies STAGING AREA or HISTORY

(more powerful and dangerous)

Different modes:

--soft → undo commit but keep everything staged

--mixed (default) → undo commit & unstage changes (keep in working directory)

--hard → delete commit + delete changes in working directory ❗ dangerous

--keep → like hard but keeps uncommitted work if possible
